`flatiron-liquid-test-paired`: uses a Fermi liquid reference state where the last pair of electrons occupy the same k-point
`flatiron-liquid-test-unpaired`: uses a Fermi liquid reference state where the last pair of electrons occupy opposite k-points, i.e., +k and -k
`flatiron-crystal-test-paired`: uses a MP wavefunction that is initalized to the paired state described above
`flatiron-crystal-test-unpaired`: uses a MP wavefunction that is initalized to the unpaired state described above
`flatiron-crystal-test-uhf`: uses a MP wavefunction that is initalized to a UHF solution of the UEG (this initial UHF solution is optimized in the absence of any Jastrow or backflow)
